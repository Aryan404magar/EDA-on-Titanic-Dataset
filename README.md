# EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset
In this basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, we aim to gain initial insights into the characteristics of the passengers and their survival outcomes. The dataset, derived from the famous Titanic disaster, includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not.
